# APRANK

**APRANK** is an Antigenic Protein and Peptide Ranker. 

**APRANK** is a bioinformatics pipeline that can:
  1) be run to rank candidate antigens and epitopes from a pathogen proteome; or 
  2) be used with curated antigenicity information to generate and train new models. 

To download the files needed to run APRANK as a predictor, go to the ***/aprank*** folder. You will also need to download the corresponding protein and/or peptide models from [Dryad](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.zcrjdfnb1).

To download the files needed to run APRANK for development of new models, go to the ***/model-development*** folder.
